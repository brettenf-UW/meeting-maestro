- **results.js**: Results page logic, task management, and email functionality

### HTML Files
- **index.html**: Landing page with file upload and demo functionality
- **results.html**: Results display with three tabs (Summary, Action Items, Follow-Up Email)

### CSS
- **styles.css**: Custom styles beyond Tailwind CSS

### Sample Data
- **sample-transcript.csv**: Demo transcript data

### Integrations
- **EmailJS**: Real email sending functionality
  - Requires Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key from EmailJS account
  - Input fields for configuration provided in the UI
  - "Send Test Email" feature to verify configuration
  - Improved error handling and feedback
  - Supports both individual and batch email sending

## How to Use Email Functionality
1. First, create an EmailJS account at https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Create an Email Service (connecting to Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create an Email Template with the following template variables:
   - to_email
   - from_name
   - from_email
   - subject
   - message
   - meeting_title
   - meeting_date
   - recipient_name
4. Enter your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key in the configuration section
   - Service ID format: `service_xxxxxxx`
   - Template ID format: `template_xxxxxxx`
   - Public Key format: `aBcDeFgH1234_XyZ`
5. Enter your sender name and email
6. Click "Send Test Email" to verify your configuration is working
7. Select recipients using the checkboxes
8. Customize the email content if needed
9. Click "Send" or "Send Personalized Emails to All"

## Recent Improvements Details

### Email Persistence and Reactivity
- **Issue Fixed**: Previously, participant email updates didn't visually persist in the UI
- **Solution**: Added a reactive flag in Alpine.js to force UI refreshes when data changes
- **Implementation**: The `refreshFlag` variable toggles after saving to trigger Alpine's reactivity
- **Enhancement**: Added `x-bind:key` binding to force Alpine to re-render the element
- **Result**: Email updates now immediately reflect in the UI and persist correctly

### Task Assignment Display
- **Enhancement**: Added a new "Grouped by Assignee" view for tasks
- **Implementation**: A toggle button allows switching between table and grouped views
- **Benefit**: Makes it much easier to see who's responsible for what at a glance
- **Additional Feature**: Visual task reassignment notifications show who the task was reassigned from and to

### Email Content Improvements
- **Enhancement**: Better organization of tasks in emails
- **Implementation**: Grouped tasks by person with clear headings 
- **Added**: Status indicators (✅ for completed, 🔄 for in progress, ⏳ for pending)
- **Benefit**: Recipients can immediately see their tasks vs. others' tasks
- **Result**: More actionable email content that clearly shows responsibilities

### Email Verification
- **New Feature**: Added "Send Test Email" functionality
- **Purpose**: Allow users to verify their email configuration is working
- **Implementation**: Sends a test email to the sender's own address
- **Fixed**: Improved EmailJS initialization to prevent sending failures
- **Added**: Public Key field to complete the EmailJS configuration
- **Enhanced**: Notification system showing detailed success/failure messages
- **Result**: More reliable email sending with better error handling
- **Benefit**: Makes troubleshooting email issues much easier

## Next Steps
