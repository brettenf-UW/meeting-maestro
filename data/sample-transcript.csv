00:30,Meeting Bot,"Participants: John Smith (Product Manager), Sarah Lee (UX Designer), Michael Johnson (Developer), Emily Chen (Marketing)"
01:30,John Smith,"Good morning everyone! Let's get started with our quarterly product planning session. We have a lot to cover today."
02:15,Sarah Lee,"I'd like to discuss the new dashboard design we've been working on. We've incorporated the feedback from the user testing sessions."
03:45,Michael Johnson,"I have concerns about the timeline for implementing all the new features. The authentication system refactoring is taking longer than expected."
05:10,Emily Chen,"From a marketing perspective, we need to finalize which features will be included in the next release so we can update our materials."
06:30,John Smith,"That's a good point, Emily. Let's prioritize the features for the next release."
08:15,Sarah Lee,"The redesigned dashboard and improved reporting features should definitely be included. Users have been requesting those the most."
09:45,Michael Johnson,"I agree with Sarah. The dashboard improvements are nearly complete anyway. But we should postpone the AI recommendation engine until next quarter."
11:20,John Smith,"Let's make a decision on this. We'll include the dashboard redesign and improved reporting in the Q2 release, but push the AI recommendations to Q3."
12:40,Emily Chen,"That works for marketing. When can we expect the final designs for the new features?"
14:15,Sarah Lee,"I can have the final designs ready by next Friday, May 3rd."
15:30,John Smith,"Great. Michael, when do you think the development team can finish implementing the dashboard and reporting features?"
16:45,Michael Johnson,"We should be able to complete the implementation by May 17th, which gives us two weeks for testing before the release."
18:10,John Smith,"Perfect. Emily, can you prepare the marketing materials by May 24th for the release on June 1st?"
19:30,Emily Chen,"Yes, that timeline works for me. I'll have everything ready by the 24th."
20:45,John Smith,"Excellent. Let's also discuss the onboarding flow improvements we've been planning."
22:15,Sarah Lee,"I've prepared some mockups for the new onboarding flow. I'll share them with everyone after the meeting."
23:45,Michael Johnson,"How does this affect our development timeline? Do we need to allocate resources to this now?"
25:10,John Smith,"No, the onboarding flow improvements will be part of the Q3 release along with the AI recommendation engine."
26:40,Emily Chen,"Should we start gathering customer testimonials for the case studies section of the website?"
28:15,John Smith,"Yes, that's a good idea. Emily, can you work with the customer success team to identify 3-5 customers for testimonials?"
29:30,Emily Chen,"I'll take care of that. I can have a list of potential customers by May 10th."
31:00,John Smith,"Great. Let's summarize our action items. Sarah will complete the final designs by May 3rd."
32:15,Sarah Lee,"Confirmed."
32:30,John Smith,"Michael and the development team will implement the dashboard and reporting features by May 17th."
33:00,Michael Johnson,"Yes, we'll make that deadline."
33:30,John Smith,"Emily will prepare marketing materials by May 24th and work on customer testimonials with a list ready by May 10th."
34:15,Emily Chen,"Got it."
35:00,John Smith,"Perfect. Let's reconvene in two weeks to check on our progress. Thank you everyone!"
36:30,Sarah Lee,"Thanks, John!"
36:45,Michael Johnson,"Sounds good, bye everyone."
